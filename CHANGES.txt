1.25 (unreleased)
-----------------

- Nothing changed yet.


1.24 (2011-12-21)
-----------------

- Adding to collage from the popup works now (L3). Needs a lizard_map
  upgrade to 3.9


1.23 (2011-11-04)
-----------------

1.22 (2011-11-04)
-----------------

1.21.1 (2011-09-22)
-------------------

- Fixed typo in the "clearer error message" from 1.21 that crashed the
  logger.


1.21 (2011-09-22)
-----------------

- Clearer error message when converting coordinates to google doesn't work. To
  aid debugging that particular error.

- Also raising WorkspaceItemError when looking up shapes via a slug, not just
  when looking it up via a primary key.

- Fixed icon color in legend, first prefered is color_inside if
  none then color #2957.

- Added errorcheck for #3033. When the shapefile does not exist, the
  adapter.search function will now return with an empty list.


1.20 (2011-06-30)
-----------------

- Added index field to ShapeLegendSingleClass to control the order of
  the legend rows. #2985


1.19 (2011-06-29)
-----------------

- Adapter.extent now uses ogr.GetExtent function. Faster and easier.

-----------------

- Limiting number of search results to 3 instead of 10.


1.17 (2011-06-16)
-----------------

- Added prj field to Shape model. The adapter (layers.py) now uses
  Shape.prj instead of reading the file.

Note: After upgrading, run the management command
lizard_shape_update_prj. This re-saves all Shape models in order to
fill the prj fields.
