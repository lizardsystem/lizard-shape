Changelog of lizard-shape
===================================================


1.27 (unreleased)
-----------------

- Raising a validationerror when a category's parent field points at
  itself. This leads to an infinite recursion error in the __unicode__,
  rendering the admin inaccessible (to fix the error...).

- Increased radius in the adapter's search(), Dave complained it was
  impossibly small.

1.26 (2012-01-23)
-----------------

- Don't show 'Grafiek' on the collage detail page since we don't
  actually have one, and don't show the dialog to edit graph options.


1.25 (2012-01-17)
-----------------

- Removed old breadcrumbs code because it didn't work with the
  new version anymore. Now needs lizard-map 3.18.

- Checking for case-insensitive extension, so .SHP is just fine for .shp.


1.24 (2011-12-21)
-----------------

- Adding to collage from the popup works now (L3). Needs a lizard_map
  upgrade to 3.9


1.23 (2011-11-04)
-----------------

- Fixed a bug that prevented the view class from working.


1.22 (2011-11-04)
-----------------

- Made view class based for lizard-map 3.3

- Changed template to use new workspace / collage tags

- Changed buildout and setup to require lizard-map >= 3.3

1.21.1 (2011-09-22)
-------------------

- Fixed typo in the "clearer error message" from 1.21 that crashed the
  logger.


1.21 (2011-09-22)
-----------------

- Clearer error message when converting coordinates to google doesn't work. To
  aid debugging that particular error.

- Also raising WorkspaceItemError when looking up shapes via a slug, not just
  when looking it up via a primary key.

- Fixed icon color in legend, first prefered is color_inside if
  none then color #2957.

- Added errorcheck for #3033. When the shapefile does not exist, the
  adapter.search function will now return with an empty list.


1.20 (2011-06-30)
-----------------

- Added index field to ShapeLegendSingleClass to control the order of
  the legend rows. #2985


1.19 (2011-06-29)
-----------------

- Adapter.extent now uses ogr.GetExtent function. Faster and easier.


1.18 (2011-06-17)
-----------------

- Limiting number of search results to 3 instead of 10.


1.17 (2011-06-16)
-----------------

- Added prj field to Shape model. The adapter (layers.py) now uses
  Shape.prj instead of reading the file.

Note: After upgrading, run the management command
lizard_shape_update_prj. This re-saves all Shape models in order to
fill the prj fields.


1.16 (2011-06-03)
-----------------

- Enabled transparency slide in lizard-shape.

- Depending on lizard-map >= 1.80 now as that does away with the javascript
  map hover handler. More performance!
